					Reddit Bot
				</h2>
				<p class="mg-lg ">
					&nbsp;So the Coffee and Code club held a 7 part workshop on how to build a Reddit bot that searches through comments and looks for cyberbullying which was super cool since it was a mind opener to social responsibility. <br><br> We went through a few examples such as how a spam detector might detect spam from keywords in emails such as "buy", "free", or "sale". <br><br> We then went through an example of getting the program to interact with Reddit. We got 100 comments from the UWaterloo and the UofT subreddits and used these comments to train the program into recognising if a comment was from UWaterloo or UofT. After training the program with 5 comments from each thread, the model accurately sorted new comments a little more than 50% of the time.<br><br> Finally, we set out to actually build the Reddit bot to detect cyberbullying. We learned how to process the incoming comments by removing non-alphanumeric characters and stemming each word (for example, the stem of 'going' is 'go'). Using a naive Bayes classifier and a Hate Speech and Offensive Language database the model classifies comments as cyberbullying or not. The end result always performed with an accuracy of more than 70%.&nbsp;<br>

					Personal Alert Monitor
				</h2>
				<p class="mg-lg ">
					Okay, so anyone who knows me knows that I hate leaving things unfinished. There's just an inner turmoil inside of me that isn't resolved until I finish solving a problem. So when I kept thinking back to the Personal Alert Monitor project from the Catalyst Engineering Summer programme, I can't help but want to finish it. We only had a few days to prepare for the competition, and that was only enough time for me to finish making the Arduino component. I've always wanted to experiment with app writing, so today I sat myself down and decided to learn how to use Android studio.<br><br> So I broke down this task into several stages. In the first stage, I would set up the basic app structure. There would be two inputs for the user, one for a phone number and one for a message to send. In the second stage, I would have the app be able to send the GPS coordinates to the user. In the third stage, the app would send SMS messages to the various contacts upon input from the Arduino device, instead of the user pressing a button in the app. In the fourth stage, I would set up a database so that the user can store and save multiple contacts to send the message to. Final stage would just be sprucing things up and making the user experience nicer.<br><br> I then finished building the prototype with the Arduino Pro Mini, which is a lot smaller than the Uno and wearable on one's wrist. It took a lot of soldering, wire stripping, and patience, but I've finally finished it.<br>

					Catalyst 2017: Business of Science Pitch
				</h2>
				<p class="mg-lg ">
					&nbsp;So I just came back from the Catalyst Engineering summer programme where my group won 1st place in the Business of Science Pitch Competition! In the competition, we had to create an innovative product and pitch it in front of four judges at the Communitech building. For more information about the exact nature of the competition, click&nbsp;<a class="link" href="downloads/BOSOutline.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>So my group created a product called the Personal Alert Monitor, or PAM for short. It's a wearable tech that is used to contact people if the user's safety is somehow compromised. It can be applied to many different situations and used by a variety of people. For example, an elderly person could contact immediate family if they have fallen down the stairs, or a young adult can contact their friends or family if they are walking alone in the city at night and feel unsafe.<br><br>PAM would be connected to the user's phone via bluetooth. When the user wants to activate it, he/she would press a button on the face of the device which connect to the PAM app already downloaded on the user's phone. The user would have already set up a message to send as well as contacts to send it to beforehand.<br><br>The device would connect to the user's phone using a Arduino Pro Mini and an Arduino Bluetooth Module. I have built a prototype using the Arduino Uno and Arduino Bluetooth Module. <br><br>To show the message being sent from the PAM to my phone, I downloaded Blueterm, an open source terminal emulator that can connect to any serial device. It is available for free on the Google Play Store.<br>
